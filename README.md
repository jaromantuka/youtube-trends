This was a test task for a job I never applied because at that time I wasn't sure I can do it. Now I kow I can =) 
I downloaded the data from Kaggle to two folders 'videos' and 'cats' and they are in the same folder as the ipynb file.
It was easier and more visually pleasing in Tableau but only after I merged the data in pandas (and the code for that was easily found on Kaggle as well))
